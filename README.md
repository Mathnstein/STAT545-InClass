# STAT545-hw01-Griffith-Cody
Hey Vincenzo! 

I'm editing this within the browser.

Now I'm editing this locally.

Here is some latex code

$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x}\,dx=1$$

I didn't know that RStudio can display latex within the notebook. That is pretty cool.

Now here is some R code.

x<-rnorm(1000)
y<-rnorm(1000)
example<-plot(x,y)
dev.print(pdf, "hw1_example.pdf")

[This goes to Stat 545 homepage](stat545.com)

I will now try to run this in R Markdown, although I don't have a functional $\Latex$ distribution at the moment. I believe that means I can only see the html version outside of github.

After Thursday's class, my terminology above is all wrong. This is a markdown file and was not created as a Rmd. I did on the otherhand create a seperate Rmd called [hw01_gapminder.Rmd](https://github.com/Mathnstein/STAT545-hw01-Griffith-Cody/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.Rmd). It produces the [hw01_gapminder.md](https://github.com/Mathnstein/STAT545-hw01-Griffith-Cody/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) with all the r code evaluated and the plots inserted.

I personally really enjoy R markdown as I'm used to having to import files into Latex where I performed my analysis on Matlab or Mathematica. The ability to contain all the work in one location is very cool._
